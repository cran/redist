\title{Renumber districts to match an existing plan}
\usage{
match_numbers(
  data,
  plan,
  total_pop = attr(data, "prec_pop"),
  col = "pop_overlap"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{redist_plans} object.}

\item{plan}{a character vector giving the name of the plan to match to (e.g.,
for a reference plan), or an integer vector containing the plan itself.}

\item{total_pop}{a vector of population counts. Should not be needed for most
\code{redist_plans} objects.}

\item{col}{the name of a new column to store the vector of population overlap
with the reference plan: the fraction of the total population who are in
the same district under each plan and the reference plan. Set to
\code{NULL} if no column should be created.
renumbering options in any plan.}
}
\value{
a modified \code{redist_plans} object. New district numbers will be
stored as an ordered factor variable in the \code{district} column. The
district numbers in the plan matrix will match the levels of this factor.
}
\description{
District numbers in simulated plans are by and large random.  This
function attempts to renumber the districts across all simulated plans to
match the numbers in a provided plan, using the Hungarian algorithm.
