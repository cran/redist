\usage{
redist.enumerate(
  adj,
  ndists = 2,
  total_pop = NULL,
  nconstraintlow = NULL,
  nconstrainthigh = NULL,
  pop_tol = NULL,
  adjobj,
  popvec,
  popcons,
  contiguitymap = "rooks"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{An adjacency list, matrix, or object of class
\code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame}.}

\item{ndists}{The desired number of congressional districts. The default is 2.}

\item{total_pop}{A vector of geographic unit populations. The default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{nconstraintlow}{Lower bound for number of geographic units to include in
a district. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{nconstrainthigh}{Lower bound for number of geographic units to include
in a district. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{pop_tol}{The strength of the hard population constraint.
\code{pop_tol} = 0.05 means that any proposed swap that brings a district more
than 5\% away from population parity will be rejected. The default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{adjobj}{Deprecated, use adj. An adjacency list, matrix, or object of class
\code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame}.}

\item{popvec}{Deprecated, use total_pop. A vector of geographic unit populations.}

\item{popcons}{Deprecated, use pop_tol. The strength of the hard population constraint.
\code{popcons} = 0.05 means that any proposed swap that brings a district more
than 5\% away from population parity will be rejected. The default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{contiguitymap}{Use queens or rooks distance criteria for generating an
adjacency list from a "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame" data type. Default is "rooks".}
}
\value{
\code{redist.enumerate} returns an object of class "list". Each entry
in the list is a vector of congressional district assignments, where the first
entry in the vector corresponds to the congressional district assignment of
the first geographic unit.
}
\description{
\code{redist.enumerate} uses a spanning-tree method to fully enumerate all
valid redistricting plans with $n$ districts given a set of geographic units.
\code{redist.enumerate} also allows users to implement minimum and maximum
numbers of geographic units per district, as well as population parity
requirements.
}
\details{
This function allows users to input a set of geographic units to
generate all valid partitions of $n$ congressional districts. The function
uses a set of spanning-tree methods to generate all valid, contiguous
partitions, which makes it more efficient than brute-force methods. However,
even with these methods, full redistricting problems quickly become
intractable, necessitating the use of the MCMC-based methods implemented in
\code{redist.mcmc}.
