\title{Combine successive runs of \code{redist.flip}}
\usage{
redist.combine(savename, nloop, nthin, temper)
}
\arguments{
\item{savename}{The name (without the loop or \code{.rds} suffix)
of the saved simulations.}

\item{nloop}{The number of loops being combined. Savename must be non-null.}

\item{nthin}{How much to thin the simulations being combined.}

\item{temper}{Wheterh simulated tempering was used (1) or not (0)
in the simulations. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
\code{redist.combine} returns an object of class "redist". The object
\code{redist} is a list that contains the following components (the
inclusion of some components is dependent on whether tempering
techniques are used):
\item{plans}{Matrix of congressional district assignments generated by the
algorithm. Each row corresponds to a geographic unit, and each column
corresponds to a simulation.}
\item{distance_parity}{Vector containing the maximum distance from parity for
a particular simulated redistricting plan.}
\item{mhdecisions}{A vector specifying whether a proposed redistricting plan
was accepted (1) or rejected (0) in a given iteration.}
\item{mhprob}{A vector containing the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
probability for each iteration of the algorithm.}
\item{pparam}{A vector containing the draw of the \code{p} parameter for each
simulation, which dictates the number of swaps attempted.}
\item{constraint_pop}{A vector containing the value of the population
constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{constraint_compact}{A vector containing the value of the compactness
constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{constraint_segregation}{A vector containing the value of the
segregation constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{constraint_vra}{A vector containing the value of the
vra constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{constraint_similar}{A vector containing the value of the similarity
constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{constraint_partisan}{A vector containing the value of the
partisan constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{constraint_minority}{A vector containing the value of the
minority constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{constraint_hinge}{A vector containing the value of the
hinge constraint for each accepted redistricting plan.}
\item{beta_sequence}{A vector containing the value of beta for each iteration
of the algorithm. Returned when tempering is being used.}
\item{mhdecisions_beta}{A vector specifying whether a proposed beta value was
accepted (1) or rejected (0) in a given iteration of the algorithm. Returned
when tempering is being used.}
\item{mhprob_beta}{A vector containing the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
probability for each iteration of the algorithm. Returned when tempering
is being used.}

\description{
\code{redist.combine} is used to combine successive runs of \code{redist.flip}
into a single data object
}
\details{
This function allows users to combine multiple successive runs of
\code{redist.flip} into a single \code{redist} object for analysis.

## Code to run the simulations in Figure 4 in Fifield, Higgins,Imai and Tarr (2015)

## Get an initial partition
